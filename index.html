					<p>
						I'm a 25 year old Cyber Security Analyst, with a background in
						Network Security, and a passion for learning and staying up-to-date
						with the latest trends in cybersecurity. I enjoy solving complex
						problems and finding innovative solutions to protect sensitive data,
						and protect systems from cyber threats.

						When I'm not working, you can usually find me riding motorcycles, or
						working on them.

						Feel free to check out what I've been working on recently (currently
						focused on upskilling myself as much as possible), or reach out to
						me through my social channels.
