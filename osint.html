					Please find a collection of useful cyber security resources and links
					that I have found helpful in my career. I will continue to update this
					page as I find more resources that I think would be helpful to others
					in the industry. I've started this list with OSINT links that I use
					daily to check varioyus IPs, domains, and hashes (Indicators of
					Compromise, or IoC's) when triaging security incidents. Feel free to
					reach out if you have any suggestions for resources to add!
